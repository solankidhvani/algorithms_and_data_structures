    "# My solution uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets. When it encounters an opening bracket ('(', '{', or '['), it push it onto the stack. When it sees a closing bracket (')', '}', or ']'), it check if it matches the most recent opening bracket at the top of the stack. If it doesn't match or the stack is empty, it will return False immediately. If it reach the end of the string and the stack is empty, that means every opening bracket had a matching closing bracket in the correct order, so it will return True. This method works well because a stack naturally handles nested and ordered structures through its Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) behavior. The most recently opened bracket must be closed first, which is exactly how stacks operate. The bracket_map dictionary allows me to quickly check if a closing bracket matches its corresponding opening bracket in O(1) time."

List indexing: `stack[-1]` is O(1). Total: One loop * O(1) operations = O(n) linear time. As the input size doubles, the runtime approximately doubles. For example: Input size 100 â†’ ~100 operations. Input size 1000 â†’ ~1000 operations (10x increase). Input size 10000 â†’ ~10000 operations (100x increase from 100)\n",

The bracket_map dictionary uses O(1) constant space (only 3 key-value pairs regardless of input size). Total space complexity is dominated by the stack O(n). In Big-O analysis, we focus on the worst-case scenario and how space grows with input size."
