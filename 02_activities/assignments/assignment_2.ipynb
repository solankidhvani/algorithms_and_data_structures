    "# Working through the \"Valid Bracket Sequence\" problem really helped me understand how stacks work and why they're so useful. I built a solution that uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets like '(', '{', and '['. Whenever I found a closing bracket, I checked if it matched the most recent opening bracket on top of the stack. If it didn't match or the stack was empty, I knew something was wrong and returned False right away. If I made it to the end with an empty stack, that meant all brackets were properly paired up. Using a bracket_map dictionary made checking matches super quick. This problem showed me how naturally stacks handle nested structures because of their Last-In-First-Out behavior. \n",

That said, I really appreciate that there are multiple ways to solve problems, and my partner's approach could definitely be useful in different situations.\n",
